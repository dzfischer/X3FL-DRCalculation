# X3FL-DRCalculation
Messy code to print out a list of valid friend/foe sets for X3:Farnham's Legacy Dynamic Reputation system.

Literlly just a .py script written in a few hours that will print() a list of possible friend/foes and the rough efficiencies of that set from the given values.
Can also be used to print() the list of which factions can simultaneously be +10 by editing a control variable at the top.
